Remember, an issue is not the place to ask questions. You can use
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions) for that, or
you may want to start a discussion on [dW Answers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/ask).

Before you open an issue, please check if a similar issue already exists or has been closed before.
